              Hi! I`m Milos, and I enjoy creating innovative solutions for the
              web. My interest in web development has been long-standing, but I
              haven`t had the opportunity to fully dedicate myself to it until
              now.
            </p>
            <p>
              My background in sports has taught me valuable skills in both
              independent work and teamwork, fostering a strong work ethic and
              discipline. I finished a one-year intensive web
              development course, where Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience with
              frontend technologies such as{" "}
              <span className="text-text-secondary">HTML</span>,{" "}
              <span className="text-text-secondary">CSS</span>,{" "}
              <span className="text-text-secondary">JavaScript</span>, and{" "}
              <span className="text-text-secondary">React</span> as well as
              backend technologies including{" "}
              <span className="text-text-secondary">Node.js</span> and{" "}
              <span className="text-text-secondary">Express</span>.
            </p>
            
            <p>I`m continuously working on my professional development and look forward to joining a team where 
              I can contribute to the company`s success and grow as a developer.
